<p id="intro">Hi there! I am a 10th grader at Waukee High School in Waukee, Iowa. I am interested in <strong>politics, business, and computer science</strong>. I enjoy writing and playing the piano in my free time. Through my extracurricular activities I am constantly growing my knowledge and meeting wonderful people along the way. I would love to get to know you as well! Feel free to contact me using resources on my <a href="contact.html"> contacts page</a>. You can also find more information about my projects and interests on the <a href="portfolio.html">porfolio page</a></p>

  <p>One of my skills include writing. I am an Alumini of the University of Iowa's Writers Room program. Here I worked with Proffesors and talented creative writers. Through this 9 week program I made many great friendships and developed my writing skills. I am also publishing a reasearch paper in 2021 Fall on the Water and Sanitation crisis in Zimbabwe. During my free time I love to journal and write spoken word poetry.</p>

There is a hand on the keyboard or the computer. The location seems to be in a resturant and it is warmly lit with yellowish candels on each table. In fornt of the computer is a glass or chilled water. This is a picture of an individual programming at a resturant at night surrounded by candels.">
  <p>Another one of my skills include programming. I am passionate about improving my coding skills, so I started a Girls Who Code club at my school. I work with various students and we all learn to program together using resources from Scratch, Trinket, GWC, etc. I also work on my programming skills through FIRST Technology Challenge and use Block code and am now transitioning to JavaScirpt.</p>
